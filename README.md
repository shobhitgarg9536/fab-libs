1. [Dozer](https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer) - Mapper that copies data from one object to another using annotations and API or XML configuration.

2. [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Declarative build and dependency management that favors convention over configuration. It might be preferable to Apache Ant, which uses a rather procedural approach and can be difficult to maintain.

3. [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Incremental builds programmed via Groovy instead of declaring XML. Works well with Maven's dependency management.
